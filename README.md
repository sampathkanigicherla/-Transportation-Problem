# -Transportation-Problem
The transportation problem is a special type of linear programming problem where the objetive consists in minimizing transportation cost of a given commodity from a number of sources or origins (e.g. factory, manufacturing facility) to a number of destinations (e.g. warehouse, store). Each source has a limited supply (i.e. maximum number of products that can be sent from it) while each destination has a demand to be satisfied (i.e. minimum number of products that need to be shipped to it). The cost of shipping from a source to a destination is directly proportional to the number of units shipped.
